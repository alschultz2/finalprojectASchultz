## Database Problems

## Challenges Faced
Some of the challanges that I faced was dealing with the login and register system. I didnt have the proper database connection which was causing the issues.
Another major issue I faced is my C drive for my computer got corrupted while working on my project. This caused me to loose alot of progress and I ended up changing from django to flask. 

## Future Work
In the future I would like to work on the styling of the project to make things look better. I would have also liked to implement a way to take the data and export it into an excel file.
